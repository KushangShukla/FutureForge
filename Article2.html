        <h1>How to Make a Resume for a Job in 2025</h1>
        <br><br>
    <h2>1. Collect all your professional information</h2>
    Past and present jobs â€“ including start and end dates, name of employer, location, job title, and a list of basic responsibilities.
    Notable achievements â€“ these could be from your academic career or professional life. Make sure to quantify your achievements on your resume using hard numbers or data where possible.
    Hard and soft skills â€“ think of any skill that might help you excel in the workplace, from data analytics to public speaking.
    Education history â€“ jot down your graduation date, school name, location, honors, and any notable coursework.
    Volunteer work or extracurriculars â€“ this could include formal or informal positions. List the name of the organization, when you were involved, and your basic duties.
    Certifications â€“ list the awarding body, when you were certified, and the official certification title.
    Awards & honors â€“ if youâ€™ve ever received an award, list the awarding body, title of the award, when you received it, and provide a brief explanation for why you were awarded.
<br><br>

<h2>2. List your contact information at the top</h2>
Contact information to include in your header

First and last name
Email address (use a professional one like firstname.lastname@gmail.com)
Phone number
Optional (but helpful) information

Online portfolio or website (if relevant to the job)
LinkedIn URL
City and State to show you're in the area
<br><br>

<h2>3. Write a convincing resume summary</h2>
A professional resume summary provides a snapshot of your primary qualifications by emphasizing your most impressive achievements and skills in 2-3 sentences.
<br><br>
How to structure work experience on your resume

Job title â€“ Dates employed (year and month)
Company name â€“ Company location (city and state)

Three to five bullet points describing your achievements and responsibilities
Include hard numbers in your bullet points when possible
Start each bullet point with an action verb
<h2>Highlight your work accomplishments with hard numbers</h2>
Demonstrate your impact as an employee by including numbers in your bullet points.

Numbers add context to your on-the-job achievements, and show hiring managers what youâ€™re capable of at work.

No numbers or action verbs (boring)

Responsible for making media kits for company projects
Both numbers and action verbs (clear)

Spearheaded the development of the first media kit for all company projects, increasing journalist pitches by 43% in the first year
<h2>Demonstrate your most valuable skills</h2>
Your skills section isnâ€™t the only place you want to highlight your talents. You should also provide real-life examples of how you put your skills to the test in your work experience section.

For example, if you have specific soft skills (like communication or time management) you want employers to know about, donâ€™t just list them out. Instead, add a bullet point to your resume demonstrating how you flexed those skills in the workplace.

Hereâ€™s an example of a work experience bullet point that effectively highlights the candidateâ€™s leadership skills:

How to highlight soft skills through your work experience

Led a cross-functional team of 10 members to successfully implement a new project management system, resulting in a 20% increase in team productivity
This way, youâ€™re not just telling employers you have leadership skills â€“ youâ€™re showing them.
